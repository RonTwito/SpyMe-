This repistory is for my engineering college(Associate Practical Software Engineering Diploma) final project, which is a spying app, which i called SPY ME.
The app is an app costumize as a news app(for weather updates based on your location). 
The app is listening to it's user, and by a certain dictionary, like <"gun", "bomb", "kill"> etc, it knows when to start recording what's the user is saying, transcribing it,
and along with the user's last known location, the whole transcribtion and the user's IPv4 address, sending the whole data to the server side, to keep on trucking the suspect, which
is the user.
The server side was built using simple Python IDLE on Pycharm, with its GUI built using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript, using a simple database.
The client side was built using Android Studio and Java.
